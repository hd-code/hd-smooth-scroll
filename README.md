# HD-Smooth-Scroll

Adds smooth scrolling to hashtag links on a website. This is a PlainJS solution. No JQuery required.

## Installation

Just download the minified file [download](./hd-smooth-scroll.min.js)

And add it to your website. It doesn't matter where you put it. However putting all JS-Files at the bottom of the HTML-document is recommended.


    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>...</head>
        <body>
            ...
            <script src="hd-smooth-scroll.min.js">
        </body>
    <html>

## Usage

This plugin works automatically! Just integrate it to your website and it will automatically scroll smoothly to a certain section if the corresponding hashtag-link was clicked.
